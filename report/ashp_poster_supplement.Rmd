# Patient Selection

There were `r format(exclude$screen, big.mark = ",")` patients identified who met inclusion criteria. Patients were then excluded for the following reasons:

* Pregnant: `r format(exclude$pregnant, big.mark = ",")`
* Prisoner: `r format(exclude$prisoners, big.mark = ",")`
* ICU stay < 12 hours: `r format(exclude$icu_short, big.mark = ",")`
* Diagnosis coding contained both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM: `r format(exclude$mult_icd_types, big.mark = ",")`
* Missing data needed to calculate risk scores: `r format(exclude$labs_missing, big.mark = ",")`
* Re-encounters (only included each patient once) : `r format(exclude$reencounter, big.mark = ",")`

This left a total of `r format(flatten_int(exclude)[1] - sum(flatten_int(exclude)[-1]), big.mark = ",")` eligible patients remaining. From these, a random sample of 200 patients were selected for inclusion in the study.
