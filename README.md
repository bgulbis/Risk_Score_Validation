Validation of ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM Codes for Automated Electronic Scoring of APACHE II, APACHE III, and SAPS II
================

Objective
---------

To evaluate the validity of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM coding algorithms in the scoring of APACHE II, APACHE III, and SAPS II in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).

Specific Aims
-------------

1.  To evaluate the accuracy of automated electronic APACHE II, APACHE III, and SAPS II scoring derived from variations of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code sets against chart reviews in ICU patients.
2.  To assess which ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM code set for APACHE II, APACHE III, and SAPS II scoring would be most reliable and practical for use in retrospective cohort studies.

Methods
-------

### Study Design

This will be a retrospective observational study. Patients will be identified by randomly selecting from stratified groups to ensure an equal number of patients with ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes.

### Inclusion criteria

-   Patients 18 years or older
-   Patients admitted to an ICU between 7/1/2014 and 6/30/2016

### Exclusion criteria

-   Patients with incomplete data
-   Pregnant patients
-   Prisoners

2.  The difference in number of comorbidities identified by electronic and manual scoring for each risk score.
3.  The number of comorbidities identified by electronic or by manual scoring but not by both.
